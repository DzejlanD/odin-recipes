    <h3> Perfect Homemade Margherita-Style Pizza </h3>
    <p> <strong>Crust:</strong>
A well-hydrated dough (around 65% water) made from bread flour or Italian “00” flour. 
It should rise slowly to develop flavor—overnight in the fridge is ideal. When baked, 
it becomes airy with a slightly charred edge and a tender bite. </p>
<p><strong>Sauce:</strong>
A fresh tomato sauce made from crushed San Marzano tomatoes, a small pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. No cooking needed—this keeps the flavor bright and clean.</p>
 <p><strong>Cheese:</strong>
Fresh mozzarella, sliced or torn into small pieces so it melts evenly without making the pizza watery. 
A sprinkle of grated Parmesan or Pecorino adds depth.</p> 
<p><strong>Toppings:</strong>
Keep it simple: fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, 
maybe a pinch of dried oregano if you want a classic pizzeria touch.</p> 
<p><strong>Finishing Touch:</strong>
Bake at the highest heat possible (home ovens: 250–300°C / 475–550°F) on a pizza stone or steel. 
The high heat creates blistered edges, melted cheese, and a perfectly crisp bottom.</p>

<h2>Detailed Steps</h2>
<h3>1. Make the Dough</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Activate the yeast:</strong> In a small bowl mix the warm water, sugar and yeast. Let sit 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
<li><strong>Form the dough:</strong> In a large bowl combine the flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and the olive oil (if using). Mix until a rough dough forms.</li>
<li><strong>Knead:</strong> Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
<li><strong>First rise:</strong> Place dough in a clean bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled. Options:
<ul>
<li>1–2 hours at room temperature, or</li>
<li>12–24 hours in the fridge for better flavor (cold ferment).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>2. Prepare the Sauce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Combine the crushed tomatoes, a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp olive oil, and oregano (optional) in a bowl.</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> cook the sauce — use it fresh so it stays bright.</li>
</ol>


<h3>3. Prepare Toppings</h3>
<p class="note">Slice or tear the mozzarella into small pieces, wash and dry basil, and have olive oil and Parmesan ready.</p>


<h3>4. Shape the Pizza</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preheat:</strong> Heat your oven as hot as it will go (250–300°C / 475–550°F). Place a pizza stone or steel inside if you have one.</li>
<li><strong>Divide:</strong> Remove the dough, divide into 2 equal balls, and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Stretch:</strong> On a lightly floured surface press from the center outward and gently stretch the dough, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust.</li>
</ol>


<h3>5. Assemble</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the stretched dough on baking paper or a floured peel.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce (avoid over-saucing).</li>
<li>Distribute mozzarella pieces evenly and sprinkle Parmesan if using.</li>
<li>Drizzle a little olive oil and add a pinch of black pepper if desired.</li>
</ol>


<h3>6. Bake</h3>
<ol>
<li>Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking tray.</li>
<li>Bake 7–12 minutes until cheese is melted and crust is golden with small charred spots.</li>
</ol>


<h3>7. Finish & Serve</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add fresh basil leaves after the pizza comes out of the oven.</li>
<li>Drizzle extra virgin olive oil, slice, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Variations & Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Want a quicker dough? Use warm water and a little extra yeast and proof for 1–2 hours only.</li>
<li>For a pan-style pizza, press the dough into a well-oiled round pan and bake at 220–230°C for 18–25 minutes.</li>
<li>For extra flavor, cold ferment the dough in the fridge for 24–72 hours.</li>
</ul>
